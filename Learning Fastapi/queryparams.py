"""
A classical method of passing the request data to the server is to append a query string to the URL.
a list of key-value pairs concatenated by the ampersand (&) forms the query string, which is appended to the URL by putting a question mark (?) as a separator. For example âˆ’

http://localhost/cgi-bin/hello.py?name=Ravi&age=20

The trailing part of the URL, after (?), is the query string, which is then parsed by the server-side script for further processing.

As mentioned, the query string is a list of parameter=value pairs concatenated by & symbol.
FastAPI automatically treats the part of the endpoint which is not a path parameter as a query string and parses it into parameters and its values. 
These parameters are passed to the function below the operation decorator.

It is possible to apply validation conditions on path parameters as well as query parameters of the URL. 
In order to apply the validation conditions on a path parameter, you need to import the Path class.

"""
The query parameters can also have the validation rules applied to them.
You have to specify them as the part of arguments of Query class constructor.
Let us add a query parameter called percent in the above function and apply the validation rules as ge=0 (i.e., greater then equal to 0) and lt=100 (less than or equal to 100)
